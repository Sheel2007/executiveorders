                    In contrast, modern presidents have generally issued fewer executive orders, though their impact and scope have often been more substantial. This trend suggests a shift from quantity to quality in executive order usage.

                    This graph shows the number of executive orders issued by year. The graph shows clear spikes in executive order usage during periods of national crisis and transition. These peaks occur during World War II, the early years of the Cold War, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    The data also shows that Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the most executive orders of any president and that the number of executive orders has generally decreased since then.

                        The biggest takeaway from this graph is that Trump's second term has started with an extremely high number of executive orders (151) and he is not even half way through his first year. This suggests that he is being more aggressive use of executive power. This trend may indicate a shift in how presidents are using executive orders to implement their policy agendas, particularly in trying to get around Congress.

              Notable patterns include significant increases in executive order usage during periods of national crisis,

              While the raw number of executive orders has generally decreased since the mid-20th century, this research
              project examines whether the scope and impact of individual orders has increased, potentially indicating a
              shift in how presidential power is exercised.
